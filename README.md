Hello!

This repository is designed to assist your internet provider, using the Fiberhome UNM/ANM system, in automating the provisioning and information queries for ONUs/ONTs by your technicians.

Use the app.py file to run the server locally and test the methods available in the Fiberhome.py code.

The comments and documentation are in Portuguese, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

You can access the repository for the Telegram Bot, which can further help automate your ONU provisioning, at: https://github.com/remo2406/FHTelegramBot
